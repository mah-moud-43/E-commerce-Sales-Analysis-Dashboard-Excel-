📊 E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

Alhamdulillah, I was able to complete one of the most powerful dashboards I’ve worked on so far — an E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard fully built in Excel.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of online e-commerce sales, designed to give clear insights into revenue, profit, transactions, customers, and product performance.

🗂 Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is designed across two main pages:

🔹 Page 1: Overall Sales Performance

This page gives a high-level overview of sales performance and includes:

Total Revenue, Total Profit, and Total Transactions – displayed at the top for a quick snapshot of business performance.

Dynamic Buttons (created using Developer tools) – allowing interactive filtering between Revenue, Profit, and Transactions views.

Geographical Sales Distribution – showing customer purchases by country, where we discovered that Australia and the United States are the top regions for sales.

🔹 Page 2: Customers & Products Analysis

This page focuses on a deeper breakdown of customers and products, featuring:

Customer Analysis – insights into customer distribution, engagement, and buying behavior.

Product Analysis – performance tracking for different products, highlighting which items drive the most revenue and profit.

⚙️ Advanced Excel Features Used

To make this dashboard fully dynamic and professional, I implemented a variety of advanced Excel tools, including:

Power Pivot – for managing data models and creating advanced relationships.

Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts – to summarize and visualize data effectively.

Slicers & Timeline Filters – for easy and interactive data filtering.

Developer Tools (Form Controls) – to build interactive buttons for toggling between different sales metrics.

Conditional Formatting & Advanced Formulas – to enhance the visualization and usability.

This project demonstrates how far Excel can go in delivering interactive dashboards that provide both business insights and decision-making support without the need for additional tools.
